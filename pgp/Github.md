# Github key

A separate key is used to sign commits in this repo.

This key is exclusively used for `github@ivy.gb.net`. It can be downloaded directly if you know how. But it's not useful for anything.

## Why not use a single key?

Because ProtonMail requires a single email address on its main PGP key.
