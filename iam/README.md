# **I AM**

- Vesica Piscis
- Your pal, lucky symmetry
- I'm a cloud of probability
  - until you look at me
- I am **trinity**
  - like **divinity**
- I am every single elf you see on DMT

## I AM

- I am the glow everything has on acid
- I am your hit to keep it lit before you pass it
- I'm the overdose
  - and the climb when you surpass it
- I am the best worst thing that could've happened
  - I'm **disastrous**
- **I AM**
  - Fluid time
  - Every cause and effect
- **I AM**
  - truth behind
    - Every creed
      - East to West
- **I AM**
  - The Conjoint Actors Spiritual Expression
    - I’m on point with acronyms
      - But that's another lesson

- I'm a complex, microtonal sus4 chord
- (I AM) Putting words in a herd, it's all I'm good for
- Fuckin up rhyme schemes
- Reconsider what **time** means
    - Open a can of mind beans
        - Like "Hey, Where’d you find these?"
```

**My mind’s making me lose it**  
So I found god and I seduced him  
    - Pillow talk with no clothes  
        - Told me all he knows  
            - And I was slow with what he showed me  
                - But I got it

---

**My code’s without a user**  
I found the goddess and confused her  
    - Between trading tones  
        - Rival notes, we bellowed  
            - Fell into a drone and it got me

## I am the all

- Don’t matter what came first
- **I am the all**
  - We’re one with the universe
- **I am the all**
  - Nobody knows how to argue
- **I am the all**
  - That I’m a god and so are you
- **I am the all**
  - Syllables in the father’s words
- **I am the all**
  - We’re all tendrils of mother earth
- **I am the all**
  - Nobody knows how to argue
- **I am the all**
  - I am a god and so are you

---

- **(I AM)**
  - Squaring the circle
    - Let me circle the square
      - I am the working third eye you thought was never there
        - I’m a hurried high dumbfuck with highlighted hair
          - With more furries lined up than the Hyatt O'Hare
            - And if you find me there, you could end me
              - I’m not family friendly, so block and unfriend me
                - Parents in the back could you blacklist my tracks
                  - On a list of role models you can put me dead last

---

- I am the ka that puts the "murr" in merkaba
- Up and downward moving vata, spinning out my chakra
  - Put in the mood for another sonata
    - I'm the double entendre of the phrase “higher conscious”

---

- The illuminati didn't want me
  - Said I was too rowdy
    - Blew the lid too loudly
      - Now I do it proudly
        - The key points aren’t astounding
          - The void in my heart creates the world around me

                - But I got it

**My code’s without a user**  
I found the goddess and seduced her  
    - Then we dove the rabbit hole as far as it goes and I don’t know what I was shown I was told

- **(I AM)**
  - Unknown troves of metaphysical BS
    - Feed into an overgrown messiah complex
      - Starseed, indigo, what do you expect?
        - Heartbeat can’t ascend 'til that ego's dead

- Sense of self that only gets you so far
  - On the fence of sub-par when compared to the stars
    - The hell lead to who you are
      - You got through it
        - Up to you to take your instrument and tune it

- But you’re human
  - We talk shit and we love it
    - Start and stirring shit and pretendin' we’re above it
      - But that nets nothing
        - When the clock’s set running
          - The best’s yet coming
            - Quit bluffing

---

- 8d shapes in god’s perfect angles
- Numbers from the angels
- Timelines tangled
  - You’re deserved
    - Find harmony, serve it
      - And if the choirs out of tune
        - Wait your turn and swerve it

**My code’s without a user**  
I found the goddess and seduced her  
    - Then we dove the rabbit hole as far as it goes and I don’t know what I was shown, but I'm god now

**My thoughts make me deny it**  
I found Thoth so I could fight him  
    - Between trading blows  
        - Rival notes we bellowed  
            - Fell into a drone and it  
                - Got me
